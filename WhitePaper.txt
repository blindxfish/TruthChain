# TruthChain: A Decentralized, Immutable Ledger of Historical Posts

## Abstract

TruthChain is a decentralized blockchain protocol designed to permanently record and preserve historical statements, posts, and texts. In a world where political figures, corporations, and media entities frequently erase or alter their past claims, TruthChain provides a censorship-resistant, tamper-proof mechanism for publishing and archiving information. It replaces traditional financial tokens with a finite, cryptographically-earned unit of information: the character.

## 1. Purpose and Vision

The goal of TruthChain is to create a globally distributed system where statements, news, or posts can be published and preserved forever, immune to modification or deletion. This supports a truthful public record and counteracts historical revisionism by preserving what was said, when it was said, by whom.

## 2. Key Concepts

### Characters as Currency

- One "character" equals one UTF-8 text character stored on-chain
- Characters are earned by keeping the network alive (i.e., running a node)
- Characters can be sent between users or burned to post messages

### Daily Character Cap

- The network produces a maximum of 280,000 characters per day (approx. 1,000 Twitter-length posts)
- Each node shares in this pool, with earnings decreasing as node count increases
- Early adopters may earn ~1120 characters/day, encouraging bootstrapping

### Posting and Transfer Mechanism

- To post a message, a user burns characters equal to the post's length
- Users may transfer characters to others using signed transactions
- All actions are cryptographically signed using wallet keypairs

### Transaction Fees

- Character transfers incur a fixed fee of 1 character (gas fee)
- This fee is burned and removed from circulation
- The fee prevents spam and incentivizes efficient use of the network
- Posting fees (character burning) are separate from transfer fees

## 3. Wallet and Identity

### Wallets are Cryptographic Keypairs

- Each user generates a public/private keypair
- The public key serves as the user's identity
- The private key is used to sign transactions and posts

### Authentication

- No usernames or passwords
- CLI users manage key files or mnemonic seeds
- Web users authenticate by uploading a wallet file, decrypting with a passphrase, or using a browser wallet extension (planned)

## 4. Node Participation and Incentives

### Mining by Uptime

- Nodes are rewarded with characters based on uptime, not proof-of-work
- Character issuance decreases logarithmically as node count grows

#### Earnings Distribution

Let C be the total daily cap (280,000 characters).

Let N be the number of active nodes.

A node's daily earnings are calculated using a logarithmic decay function to balance early adoption with long-term fairness.

**Final Reward Table:**

| Nodes Online (N) | Characters per Node/day | Total Characters Emitted |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1                | 1,120                   | 1,120                        |
| 10               | 1,037                   | 10,370                       |
| 100              | 800                     | 80,000                      |
| 500              | 451                     | 225,500                     |
| 1,000            | 280                     | 280,000 (hard cap hit)   |
| 10,000           | ~27                     | 280,000                      |
| 100,000          | ~2.7                    | 280,000                      |

The network reaches full saturation (280,000/day) around 1,000 nodes.

Beyond that, per-node reward decreases significantly, creating scarcity and value.

### Beacon Node Incentives

- Beacon nodes receive +50% character reward for acting as public entry points
- Beacon nodes increase network stability and discoverability
- Beacon announcements are minted into blocks for permanent record

### Incentive Model

- Characters become scarcer and more valuable over time
- Users must run a node or obtain characters from others to post
- Transaction fees (1 character per transfer) are burned, creating additional deflationary pressure
- The dual fee system (posting + transfer) ensures network sustainability
