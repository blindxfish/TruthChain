# TruthChain: How to Use Guide
## A Beginner's Guide to the Decentralized Truth Network

---

## üåü What is TruthChain?

**TruthChain is like a permanent, unchangeable Twitter that runs on your computer.**

Imagine if every tweet, post, or statement made by politicians, companies, or anyone else could never be deleted or changed. That's what TruthChain does - it creates a permanent record of what people say, when they said it, and who said it.

### Why This Matters
- **No More Deleted Tweets**: Politicians can't delete embarrassing posts
- **No More Fake News**: Once something is posted, it stays forever
- **Historical Record**: Future generations can see what was actually said
- **Censorship Resistant**: No government or company can remove posts

---

## üí∞ How It Works (The Simple Version)

### Characters as Money
- Instead of dollars or Bitcoin, TruthChain uses "characters"
- **1 character = 1 letter/space/punctuation mark** in your posts
- To post "Hello World!" (12 characters), you need 12 characters in your wallet

### How to Get Characters
- **Run a TruthChain node** (your computer) to earn characters automatically
- **Receive characters** from other users
- **Early adopters earn more** - the sooner you start, the more you earn

### Example
- Post: "I love TruthChain!" = 18 characters needed
- If you have 100 characters in your wallet, you can post this
- After posting, you'll have 82 characters left

## üöÄ Getting Started (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Download and Install

1. **Download TruthChain** from the official repository
2. **Extract the files** to a folder on your computer
3. **Open Command Prompt/Terminal** in that folder

### Step 2: Bitcoin-Style Setup (NEW!)

TruthChain now features a Bitcoin-style experience with persistent configuration:

```bash
# Simply run TruthChain.exe
./TruthChain.exe
```

**First Time Setup:**

1. **Wallet Configuration**
   - Choose to create a new wallet or import an existing one
   - If importing, paste your private key
   - Wallet is automatically saved to `wallet.json`
   - A comprehensive `YourWalletInfo.txt` file is created with security instructions

2. **Network Selection**
   - **Mainnet**: Production network (recommended for most users)
   - **Testnet**: Development network (for testing)
   - **Local**: Isolated network (for development)

3. **Node Modes**
   - **API Server**: Enable HTTP API for web interfaces
   - **Mesh Network**: Connect to other nodes
   - **Beacon Mode**: Announce your node publicly (+50% rewards)
   - **Uptime Mining**: Earn characters by keeping node online

4. **Port Configuration**
   - API Port (default: 8080)
   - Mesh Port (default: 9876) - handles both mesh and chain sync

5. **Domain Setup** (if beacon mode)
   - Enter your domain (e.g., mynode.truth-chain.org)

6. **Database Configuration**
   - Choose database file location (default: truthchain.db)

7. **Final Confirmation**
   - Review your configuration
   - Configuration automatically saved to `truthchain-config.json`
   - Start the node automatically

**Subsequent Runs:**
- App detects existing data automatically
- Loads saved configuration from `truthchain-config.json`
- Skips setup entirely - just works like Bitcoin Core!
- No crashes, no repeated configuration

### Step 3: Your Wallet Information

After setup, you'll have:

- **`wallet.json`**: Your wallet file (keep secure)
- **`truthchain-config.json`**: Your saved configuration (created automatically)
- **`YourWalletInfo.txt`**: Comprehensive wallet information including:
  - Your wallet address (safe to share)
  - Your private key (NEVER share this!)
  - Security best practices
  - How to import on other devices
  - API usage examples

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Keep `YourWalletInfo.txt` in a secure location. It contains your private key!

**üîÑ Bitcoin-Style Restart**: On subsequent runs, the app will automatically detect your existing data and load your saved configuration - no setup required!

## üìù Making Your First Post

### Step 4: Create a Post via API

Once your node is running, you can create posts using the API:

```bash
# Check your balance first
curl http://localhost:8080/wallets/YOUR_ADDRESS/balance

# Create a post (replace YOUR_ADDRESS with your actual address)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"Hello, TruthChain! This is my first post."}' \
  http://localhost:8080/posts
```

**What happens:**
- Your message is signed with your wallet
- It's added to the blockchain (permanent record)
- Characters are deducted from your wallet
- "Hello, TruthChain! This is my first post." = 47 characters used

### Step 5: Check Your Posts

```bash
# Check pending posts
curl http://localhost:8080/posts/pending

# Check latest block
curl http://localhost:8080/blockchain/latest
```

---

## üîÑ Sending Characters to Others

### Step 6: Send Characters

```bash
# Send 100 characters to another address
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to":"RECIPIENT_ADDRESS","amount":100}' \
  http://localhost:8080/transfers
```

**What happens:**
- 100 characters are sent to the recipient
- 1 character is used as a "gas fee" (like a transaction fee)
- Total cost: 101 characters
- The transfer is signed and secure

### Step 7: Check Transfers

```bash
# Check pending transfers
curl http://localhost:8080/transfers/pending
```

## üåê Network Participation

### Step 8: Understanding Network Modes

**API Mode** (Port 8080)
- Provides HTTP API for web interfaces
- Required for creating posts and checking balances
- Only accessible from localhost by default

**Mesh Mode** (Port 9876)
- Connects to other TruthChain nodes
- Syncs blocks and posts across the network
- Handles both mesh communication and chain synchronization
- Only one port needed for all network communication
- **Self-connection detection** prevents duplicate peer counting

**Beacon Mode**
- Announces your node to the network
- Requires a public domain pointing to your IP
- Earns +50% character rewards
- Helps other nodes discover the network

**Mining Mode**
- Earns characters based on uptime
- Requires 80% uptime over 24 hours
- Rewards distributed every 10 minutes
- Heartbeats logged every hour

### Step 9: Network Configuration

**For Mainnet (Production):**
- Use default settings from interactive setup
- Fixed consensus rules ensure compatibility
- Post threshold: 5 posts per block

**For Testnet (Development):**
- Relaxed settings for testing
- Post threshold: 3 posts per block

**For Local (Development):**
- Minimal settings for local testing
- Post threshold: 2 posts per block

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Wallet Security
1. **Backup your wallet**: Save `YourWalletInfo.txt` in multiple secure locations
2. **Protect your private key**: Never share it with anyone
3. **Use secure environments**: Clean computers with updated software
4. **Regular backups**: Test your backup by importing on a test system

### Network Security
1. **Firewall configuration**: Only open necessary ports (8080 for API, 9876 for mesh)
2. **Domain security**: Use secure domains for beacon mode
3. **Regular updates**: Keep your node software updated

### File Permissions
- `wallet.json`: 600 (owner read/write only)
- `YourWalletInfo.txt`: 600 (owner read/write only)
- `truthchain.db`: 600 (owner read/write only)
- `truthchain-config.json`: 600 (owner read/write only)
- `truthchain-config.json`: 600 (owner read/write only)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Uptime too low for rewards"**
- This is normal when you first start
- Need 80% uptime over 24 hours to receive rewards
- Keep your node running continuously

**"Wallet not found"**
- Make sure `wallet.json` exists in your directory
- Check file permissions
- Try importing your wallet again

**"Port already in use"**
- Change the port in the interactive setup
- Or stop other services using the same port

**"Genesis block mismatch"**
- Delete `truthchain.db` to reset the chain
- Restart the node

**"App crashes on restart"**
- This is now fixed! TruthChain uses Bitcoin-style restart
- App automatically detects existing data and loads saved configuration
- No more crashes when restarting with existing database

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: Look for error messages in the terminal
2. **Verify configuration**: Make sure ports and settings are correct
3. **Check file permissions**: Ensure wallet and database files are secure
4. **Restart the node**: Sometimes a simple restart fixes issues
