# TruthChain

A decentralized blockchain protocol designed to permanently record and preserve historical statements, posts, and texts. TruthChain provides a censorship-resistant, tamper-proof mechanism for publishing and archiving information, replacing traditional financial tokens with a finite, cryptographically-earned unit of information: the character.

## üéØ Vision

In a world where political figures, corporations, and media entities frequently erase or alter their past claims, TruthChain creates a globally distributed system where statements, news, or posts can be published and preserved forever, immune to modification or deletion. This supports a truthful public record and counteracts historical revisionism.

## üîë Key Concepts

### Characters as Currency
- **One "character"** = one UTF-8 text character stored on-chain
- **Earned** by keeping the network alive (running a node)
- **Burned** to post messages
- **Transferable** between users

### Daily Character Cap
- **280,000 characters per day** (‚âà1,000 Twitter-length posts)
- Shared among all online nodes with logarithmic decay
- Early adopters earn more, encouraging network bootstrapping

### Immutable Posts
- All posts are cryptographically signed
- Stored permanently on-chain
- Cannot be modified or deleted
- Verifiable authorship and timestamp

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Wallet System**: ECDSA key generation, signing, storage
- **Block & Post Logic**: Hash, sign, and verify methods
- **Local Storage**: BoltDB for persistent data
- **Uptime Tracker**: Character reward distribution
- **HTTP API**: Local interface for frontends
- **Character Transfer**: User-to-user transactions

### Security Model
- All posts and transfers signed with private keys
- Local API only (127.0.0.1) - no exposed network ports by default
- Frontends act as display + signing tools
- Node is the source of truth

## üìä Economic Model

### Node Rewards
Nodes earn characters based on uptime, not proof-of-work. Character issuance decreases logarithmically as node count grows:

| Nodes Online | Characters per Node/day | Total Characters Emitted |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1            | 1,120                   | 1,120                    |
| 10           | 1,037                   | 10,370                   |
| 100          | 800                     | 80,000                   |
| 500          | 451                     | 225,500                  |
| 1,000        | 280                     | 280,000 (hard cap)       |
| 10,000       | ~27                     | 280,000                  |
| 100,000      | ~2.7                    | 280,000                  |

### Incentive Structure
- Characters become scarcer and more valuable over time
- Users must run a node or obtain characters from others to post
- Early adoption is rewarded with higher daily earnings
