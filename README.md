# TruthChain

A decentralized blockchain protocol designed to permanently record and preserve historical statements, posts, and texts. TruthChain provides a censorship-resistant, tamper-proof mechanism for publishing and archiving information, replacing traditional financial tokens with a finite, cryptographically-earned unit of information: the character.

## üéØ Vision

In a world where political figures, corporations, and media entities frequently erase or alter their past claims, TruthChain creates a globally distributed system where statements, news, or posts can be published and preserved forever, immune to modification or deletion. This supports a truthful public record and counteracts historical revisionism.

## üîë Key Concepts

### Characters as Currency
- **One "character"** = one UTF-8 text character stored on-chain
- **Earned** by keeping the network alive (running a node)
- **Burned** to post messages
- **Transferable** between users with secure ECDSA signatures

### Daily Character Cap
- **280,000 characters per day** (‚âà1,000 Twitter-length posts)
- Shared among all online nodes with logarithmic decay
- Early adopters earn more, encouraging network bootstrapping

### Immutable Posts
- All posts are cryptographically signed with ECDSA
- Stored permanently on-chain
- Cannot be modified or deleted
- Verifiable authorship and timestamp

### Secure Transfers
- Character transfers signed with ECDSA private keys
- Public key recovery for signature verification
- Nonce-based replay protection
- Gas fees for network sustainability (1 character)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Bitcoin-Style Setup (v0.2.0 - Enhanced Security)
TruthChain v0.2.0 features **Bitcoin-style security** with strict genesis validation and enforced consensus:

```bash
# Download and run TruthChain
./TruthChain.exe

# First time: Interactive setup guides you through:
# 1. Create or import a wallet
# 2. Select network (Mainnet/Testnet/Local)
# 3. Choose node modes (API/Mesh/Beacon/Mining)
# 4. Configure ports and settings
# 5. Bitcoin-style initial sync from trusted peers
# 6. Configuration automatically saved for future starts

# Subsequent runs: App validates genesis and loads existing data
# No setup required - just works like Bitcoin Core!
```

### üõ°Ô∏è New Security Features (v0.2.0)
- **Canonical Genesis**: All nodes must have the same genesis block
- **No Local Forks**: New nodes cannot create local genesis blocks
- **Header-First Sync**: Faster, safer synchronization
- **Burn-Weight Consensus**: Prefers chains with higher character burn
- **Automatic Reorgs**: Switches to better chains automatically

### What You'll Get

- ‚úÖ **Persistent Configuration**: Settings saved to `truthchain-config.json`
- ‚úÖ **Self-Connection Detection**: No duplicate peer counting or self-pinging
- ‚úÖ **Wallet Creation/Import**: Create new wallet or import existing one
- ‚úÖ **Network Selection**: Choose between Mainnet, Testnet, or Local

- **Wallet Info**: `YourWalletInfo.txt` file with security instructions
- **Backup/Restore**: Complete wallet backup and restore functionality

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Wallet System**: ECDSA key generation, signing, storage with Base58Check addresses
- **Block & Post Logic**: Hash, sign, and verify methods with secure signature recovery
- **Transfer System**: Signed character transfers with validation and state management
- **Local Storage**: BoltDB for persistent data with mempool persistence
- **Uptime Tracker**: Character reward distribution with 80% uptime requirement
- **HTTP API**: Local interface for frontends
- **State Manager**: Wallet states, balances, and nonce tracking
- **Mesh Network**: Peer-to-peer communication and block synchronization
- **Beacon System**: Network discovery and public node announcements

### Security Model
- All posts and transfers signed with ECDSA private keys
- Public key recovery from compact signatures ensures authorship validation
- Local API only (127.0.0.1) - no exposed network ports by default
- Frontends act as display + signing tools
- Node is the source of truth
- Fork protection with hardcoded mainnet rules
- Wallet files with proper permissions (600)

## üìä Economic Model

### Node Rewards
Nodes earn characters based on uptime, not proof-of-work. Character issuance decreases logarithmically as node count grows:

| Nodes Online | Characters per Node/day | Total Characters Emitted |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1            | 1,120                   | 1,120                    |
| 10           | 1,037                   | 10,370                   |
| 100          | 800                     | 80,000                   |
| 500          | 451                     | 225,500                  |
| 1,000        | 280                     | 280,000 (hard cap)       |
| 10,000       | ~27                     | 280,000                  |
| 100,000      | ~2.7                    | 280,000                  |

### Uptime Requirements
- **80% uptime over 24 hours** required to receive rewards
- Rewards distributed every 10 minutes when requirements are met
- Heartbeats logged every hour for uptime tracking

### Transfer Economy
- **Gas Fee**: 1 character per transfer (fixed)
- **Transfer Cost**: Amount + 1 character gas fee
- **Nonce System**: Prevents replay attacks and ensures transaction ordering
- **State Management**: Real-time balance tracking with pending transaction consideration

### Incentive Structure
- Characters become scarcer and more valuable over time
- Users must run a node or obtain characters from others to post
- Early adoption is rewarded with higher daily earnings
- Transfer fees provide network sustainability
- **Beacon nodes receive +50% character reward** for acting as public entry points and increasing network stability

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Wallet Security
- **Backup your wallet**: Save `YourWalletInfo.txt` in multiple secure locations
- **Protect your private key**: Never share it with anyone
- **Use secure environments**: Clean computers with updated software
- **Regular backups**: Test your backup by importing on a test system

### Network Security
- **Firewall configuration**: Only open necessary ports (8080 for API, 9876 for mesh)
- **Domain security**: Use secure domains for beacon mode
- **Regular updates**: Keep your node software updated
