# TruthChain: How to Use Guide
## A Beginner's Guide to the Decentralized Truth Network

---

## üåü What is TruthChain?

**TruthChain is like a permanent, unchangeable Twitter that runs on your computer.**

Imagine if every tweet, post, or statement made by politicians, companies, or anyone else could never be deleted or changed. That's what TruthChain does - it creates a permanent record of what people say, when they said it, and who said it.

### Why This Matters
- **No More Deleted Tweets**: Politicians can't delete embarrassing posts
- **No More Fake News**: Once something is posted, it stays forever
- **Historical Record**: Future generations can see what was actually said
- **Censorship Resistant**: No government or company can remove posts

---

## üí∞ How It Works (The Simple Version)

### Characters as Money
- Instead of dollars or Bitcoin, TruthChain uses "characters"
- **1 character = 1 letter/space/punctuation mark** in your posts
- To post "Hello World!" (12 characters), you need 12 characters in your wallet

### How to Get Characters
- **Run a TruthChain node** (your computer) to earn characters automatically
- **Receive characters** from other users
- **Early adopters earn more** - the sooner you start, the more you earn

### Example
- Post: "I love TruthChain!" = 18 characters needed
- If you have 100 characters in your wallet, you can post this
- After posting, you'll have 82 characters left

---

## üöÄ Getting Started (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Download and Install

1. **Download TruthChain** from the official repository
2. **Extract the files** to a folder on your computer
3. **Open Command Prompt/Terminal** in that folder

### Step 2: Create Your First Wallet

```bash
# Create a new wallet (this is like creating a bank account)
./truthchain.exe --show-wallet

# This will create a file called "wallet.key" in your folder
# This file contains your private key - KEEP IT SAFE!
```

**What happens:**
- A new wallet file is created (`wallet.key`)
- You'll see your wallet address (like a bank account number)
- This address is your identity on TruthChain

### Step 3: Add Some Characters (For Testing)

```bash
# Add 1000 characters to your wallet for testing
./truthchain.exe --add-balance 1000

# Check your balance
./truthchain.exe --show-wallet
```

**What happens:**
- Your wallet now has 1000 characters
- You can use these to post messages

---

## üìù Making Your First Post

### Step 4: Post a Message

```bash
# Post your first message to TruthChain
./truthchain.exe --post "Hello, TruthChain! This is my first post."

# Check your posts
./truthchain.exe --posts
```

**What happens:**
- Your message is signed with your wallet
- It's added to the blockchain (permanent record)
- Characters are deducted from your wallet
- "Hello, TruthChain! This is my first post." = 47 characters used

### Step 5: Check Your Balance

```bash
# See your remaining balance
./truthchain.exe --show-wallet
```

**What happens:**
- You'll see your remaining characters (1000 - 47 = 953)

---

## üîÑ Sending Characters to Others

### Step 6: Send Characters to Another User

```bash
# Send 100 characters to another address
./truthchain.exe --send 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa --amount 100

# Check your transfer pool
./truthchain.exe --show-transfers
```

**What happens:**
- 100 characters are sent to the recipient
- 1 character is used as a "gas fee" (like a transaction fee)
- Total cost: 101 characters
- The transfer is signed and secure

### Step 7: Process Transfers

```bash
# Process pending transfers
./truthchain.exe --process-transfers
```

**What happens:**
- Transfers are finalized and added to the blockchain
- Recipients receive their characters
- Gas fees are burned (removed from circulation)

---

## üåê Starting Your Node (Earning Characters)

### Step 8: Start Your Node to Earn Characters

```bash
# Start your node (this earns you characters over time)
./truthchain.exe

# Or start with API server for web interface
./truthchain.exe --api-port 8080
```

**What happens:**
- Your computer becomes a TruthChain node
- You start earning characters based on uptime
- Your node helps keep the network running
- You can see live statistics

### Step 9: Check Your Earnings

```bash
# View uptime and earnings information
./truthchain.exe --monitor
```

**What happens:**
- You'll see your uptime percentage
- Character balance and earnings
- Network statistics
- Live updates every few seconds

---

## üîó Connecting to Other Nodes

### Step 10: Join the Network

```bash
# Start mesh network mode (connect to other nodes)
./truthchain.exe --mesh --mesh-port 9876

# Or start beacon mode (be a public entry point)
./truthchain.exe --beacon --beacon-ip YOUR_IP --beacon-port 9876
```

**What happens:**
- Your node connects to other TruthChain nodes
- You can sync blocks and posts from others
- You help propagate messages across the network
- Beacon nodes earn +50% more characters

### Step 11: Sync from Other Nodes

```bash
# Sync blocks from another node
./truthchain.exe --sync-from 192.168.1.100:9876

# Start a sync server for others to connect to
./truthchain.exe --sync-port 9877
```

**What happens:**
- You download the latest blocks from other nodes
- Your local blockchain stays up to date
- You can serve blocks to other nodes

---

## üåê Using the Web Interface

### Step 12: Access the Web API

```bash
# Start the web interface
./truthchain.exe --api-port 8080
```

**Then open your web browser and go to:**
- `http://127.0.0.1:8080/status` - See node status
- `http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet` - View your wallet
- `http://127.0.0.1:8080/balance` - Check your balance

### Step 13: Post via Web Interface

**Using curl (command line):**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"Hello from the web interface!"}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/post
```

**What happens:**
- Your post is created via the web API
- It's added to the blockchain
- Characters are deducted from your wallet
- You get a JSON response with the result

---

## üìä Understanding the Blockchain

### Step 14: Explore the Blockchain

```bash
# View blockchain status
./truthchain.exe --status

# See recent blocks
./truthchain.exe --blocks

# View pending posts (mempool)
./truthchain.exe --mempool

# Force create a new block
./truthchain.exe --force-block
```

**What happens:**
- You can see the current state of the blockchain
- View all posts and transfers
- See how many blocks have been created
- Check pending transactions

TRUTHCHAIN - DECENTRALIZED TRUTH NETWORK
========================================

TruthChain is a decentralized blockchain system for immutable posts and character-based currency.
This guide shows you how to run TruthChain nodes and interact with the network.

QUICK START
-----------

1. Build TruthChain:
   go build -o truthchain cmd/main.go

2. Run a full node (recommended for mainnet):
   ./truthchain -beacon -mesh -mining -api

3. Access the API:
   http://localhost:8080/status

NODE MODES
----------

TruthChain supports different node modes that can be combined:

BEACON MODE (-beacon)
- Announces your node to the network for discovery
- Other nodes can find and connect to you
- Use with -domain for public domain announcements
- Example: ./truthchain -beacon -domain mainnet.truth-chain.org

MESH MODE (-mesh)
- Participates in the peer-to-peer mesh network
- Syncs blockchain data with other nodes
- Required for full network participation
- Example: ./truthchain -mesh

MINING MODE (-mining)
- Enables uptime mining for character rewards
- Earns characters for keeping your node online
- Requires beacon mode for network discovery
- Example: ./truthchain -beacon -mining

API MODE (-api, default: true)
- Runs the HTTP API server
- Allows external applications to interact with your node
- Can be disabled for headless operation
- Example: ./truthchain -mesh -api=false

STANDALONE API SERVER
---------------------

For production deployments, you can run the API server independently:

1. Build the standalone API server:
   go build -o api-server cmd/api_server/main.go

2. Run the API server (connects to existing node database):
   ./api-server -db truthchain.db -port 8080

3. Stop/start the API server without affecting the node:
   # Stop API server (Ctrl+C)
   # Node continues running
   # Start API server again
   ./api-server -db truthchain.db -port 8080

This allows you to:
- Restart the API server for maintenance
- Run multiple API servers on different ports
- Separate API concerns from node operation
- Update API without stopping the node

NODE MANAGEMENT
--------------

GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN
- Press Ctrl+C to stop the node gracefully
- The node will:
  * Stop all network connections
  * Close database connections properly
  * Save current state
  * Exit cleanly

RESTARTING NODES
- Your blockchain data is preserved in the database
- Restart with the same configuration
- The node will sync with the network automatically
- Genesis block is consistent across restarts

DATABASE MANAGEMENT
- Database file: truthchain.db (default)
- Location: Current directory (use -db to specify path)
- Backup: Copy the .db file while node is stopped
- Reset: Delete the .db file to start fresh

NETWORK CONFIGURATION
--------------------

PORTS
- API Server: 8080 (default, use -api-port)
- Mesh Network: 9876 (default, use -mesh-port)
- Chain Sync: 9877 (default, use -sync-port)

DOMAIN CONFIGURATION
- For beacon nodes, specify your domain with -domain
- Example: ./truthchain -beacon -domain mainnet.truth-chain.org
- Ensure DNS points to your server
- Configure port forwarding for mesh/sync ports

FIREWALL SETUP
- Open ports 9876 (mesh) and 9877 (sync) for network communication
- Port 8080 (API) for external API access
- Use UPNP or manual port forwarding
